Kakuro is a numeric crossword puzzle, Sudoku's big brother.

Each clued subset of a row or column must contain unique numbers, between 1 and 9, that add up to the clue. You can enter hints, small numbers that allow you to narrow the possibilities for each cell.

The app includes instructions, rules, and a tactics tutorial.

You get, for free, ten puzzle layouts, five in 6x6 and five in 8x8. For $0.99, you can purchase 190 more layouts, in 6x6, 8x8, and 10x10. You can also play in your web browser, at Kakuro-Dojo.com, and, if you pay for the additional puzzles in the app, you'll get a URL to enable those layouts on the web.

The free app has no ads, except a "Commercial Message" page, which you can see above, that quietly reminds you of the available in-app purchase, whenever you attempt to advance beyond the fifth game or select the 10x10 layout.

I've been playing it daily for months, as I tuned the game play. It never gets old.
