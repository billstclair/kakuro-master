List of tasks remaining for [Kakuro-Dojo.com](https:/Kakuro-Dojo.com/).

1. Create encoders and decoders for stored JSON state. [**done**]

2. Switch backend to save/restore strings, and use the encoders/decoders on the Elm side. Use [billstclair/elm-versioned-json](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-versioned-json/latest) to make it easy to change the state in the future. [**done**]

3. Integrate [billstclair/elm-dynamodb](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-dynamodb/latest), to share state across browsers/devices. [**won't do**]

4. Minimize the home page, with links to go to Rules, Tutorial, Links. [**done**]

5. Write Rules. [**done**]

6. Write Tutorial, with screen shots showing the solution of an easy and harder puzzle. [**done**]

7. Wrap the whole thing in an iOS app, likely with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Adobe PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/), or [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/). [See [Native Apps Are Doomed](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/native-apps-are-doomed-ac397148a2c0#.48qr70u0a)]
